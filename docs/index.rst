Welcome to django-braces's documentation!
=========================================

`django-braces` is a collection of mixins for Django's generic class-based views.
Mixins are reusable bits of code that can be mixed into any number of different
views to add useful behaviors. Most mixins are small and only add one or two
attributes or methods to your standard view class.

All of the code is available on `Github`_ under the BSD 3-Clause license. If you
have similar mixins of your own, please `contribute`_ them back to the project.

You can view the code of our project or fork it and add your own mixins (please, send them back to us), on `Github`_.
