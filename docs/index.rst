Welcome to django-braces's documentation!
=========================================

`django-braces` is a collection of mixins for Django's generic
class-based views. Mixins are reusable bits of code that can be _mixed_
into any number of different views to add useful behaviors quickly and
reliably. Most mixins are small and only add one or two attributes or
methods to your standard view class.

All of the code is available on `Github`_ under the BSD 3-Clause license.
If you have similar mixins of your own, please `contribute`_ them back
to the project.

You can view the code of our project on `Github`_. We welcome and love
`contributions <contributing.html>`_!
