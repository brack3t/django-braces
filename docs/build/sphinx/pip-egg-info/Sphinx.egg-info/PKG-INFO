Description: 
        Sphinx is a tool that makes it easy to create intelligent and beautiful
        documentation for Python projects (or other documents consisting of multiple
        reStructuredText sources), written by Georg Brandl.  It was originally created
        for the new Python documentation, and has excellent facilities for Python
        project documentation, but C/C++ is supported as well, and more languages are
        planned.
        
        Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths
        come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText and its parsing
        and translating suite, the Docutils.
        
        Among its features are the following:
        
        * Output formats: HTML (including derivative formats such as HTML Help, Epub
          and Qt Help), plain text, manual pages and LaTeX or direct PDF output
          using rst2pdf
        * Extensive cross-references: semantic markup and automatic links
          for functions, classes, glossary terms and similar pieces of information
        * Hierarchical structure: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic
          links to siblings, parents and children
        * Automatic indices: general index as well as a module index
        * Code handling: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter
        * Flexible HTML output using the Jinja 2 templating engine
        * Various extensions are available, e.g. for automatic testing of snippets
          and inclusion of appropriately formatted docstrings
        * Setuptools integration
