Release 0.8.1 (2011-08-30)
==========================


Release 0.8 (2011-07-07)
========================

* COPYING:

  - Some additions to the Docutils core are released under the 2-Clause BSD
    license.

* General:

  - Handle language codes according to `BCP 47`_.
  - If the specified langauage is not supported by Docutils,
    warn and fall back to English.
  - Math support: reStructuredText "math" role and directive,
    ``math`` and ``math_block`` doctree elements.
  - Orphaned "python" reader and "newlatex2e" writer moved to the sandbox.

  .. _BCP 47: http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt

* reStructuredText:

  - most directives now support a "name" option that attaches a
    reference name. So you can write ::

      .. figure:: image.png
         :name: figure name

    as a short form of ::

      .. _figure name:

      .. figure:: image.png

Internationalization:

* Added lithuanian mappings.

Components:

* HTML writer:

  - New setting "math-output" with support for HTML, MathML, and LaTeX.

* LaTeX2e writer:

  - Convert image URI to a local file path.
  - Apply [ 3148141 ] fix multicolumn support when a colspanning cell
    has more than one paragraph (Wolfgang Scherer).

* XeTeX writer:

  - New writer generating LaTeX code for compiling with ``xelatex``.
    
    XeTeX uses unicode and modern font technologies.

* and fixes and enhancements here and there.
  
Release 0.7 (2010-07-07)
========================

Components:

* HTML writer:

  - Support SVG and SWF images (thanks to Stefan Rank).
  - Generate valid XHTML for centered images with targets.
    Use CSS classes instead of "align" tags for image alignment.

* LaTeX2e writer:

  - Use the ``\url`` command for URLs (breaks long URLs instead of writing
    into the margin).
  - Preserve runs of spaces in 'inline literals'.
  - Deprecate ``figure_footnotes`` setting.
  - Rename ``use_latex_footnotes`` setting to `docutils_footnotes`__.
  - New ``latex_preamble`` setting.
  - Use PDF standard fonts (Times/Helvetica/Courier) as default.
  - `hyperref` package called with ``unicode`` option (see the
    `hyperref config tips`__ for how to override).
  - Drop the special `output_encoding`__ default ("latin-1").
    The Docutils wide default (usually "UTF-8") is used instead.

__ docs/user/config.html#docutils-footnotes
__ docs/user/latex.html#hyperlinks
__ docs/user/latex.html#output-encoding

* manpage writer:

  - Titles level 1, that is ``.SH``, always uppercase.
  - Apply patch from mg: literal text should be bold in man-pages.

General:

* io.FileInput opens files as text files with universal newline support
  (mode "rU", configurable with the new optional argument "mode").

* setup.py:

  - Python 3 support: copy test/ and tools/ to the build-dir
    and convert Python sources with 2to3.

Release 0.6 (2009-10-11)
========================

.. Note::

   Docutils 0.5 is the last version supporting Python 2.2.

   Docutils 0.6 is compatible with Python versions from 2.3 up to 2.6
   and convertible to 3.1 code.

.. note::

   The "newlatex" writer is orphaned.

   The recommended way to generate PDF output is to use either the
   LaTeX2e writer or one of the alternatives listed at
   http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html#pdf.

* reStructuredText:

  - Allow length units for all length specifications.
  - Allow percent sign in "scale" argument of "figure" and "image" directives.
  - Bugfix: The "figalign" argument of a figure now works as intended
    (aligning the figure not its contents).
  - Align images with class "align-[right|center|left]"
    (allows setting the alignment of an image in a figure).
  - Hard tabs in literal inclusions are replaced by spaces. This is
    configurable via the new "tab-width" option of the "include" directive
    (a negative tab-width prevents tab expansion).

* HTML writer:

  - ``--stylesheet`` and ``--stylesheet-path`` options now support a comma
    separated list of stylesheets.

* LaTeX2e writer:

  - New defaults:
    - font-encoding: "T1" (formerly implicitely set by 'ae').
    - use-latex-toc: true (ToC with page numbers).
    - use-latex-footnotes: true (no mixup with figures).
    - Float placement defaults to "here definitely" (configurable).
    - Align of image in a figure defaults to 'center'.
    - Use class defaults for page margins ('typearea' now optional).
  - Support LaTeX packages as ``--stylesheet`` arguments.
  - Use ``bp`` for lengths without unit or unit ``pt``,
    do not convert ``px`` to ``pt``.
  - Do not use 'ae' and 'aeguill' packages if font-encoding is set to ''.
  - Set sub- and superscript role argument as text not math.
  - Support custom roles based on standard roles.
  - Load packages and define macros only if required in the document.
  - All Docutils specific LaTeX macros are prefixed with ``DU``.
  - Better conformance to Docutils specifications with "use_latex_toc".
  - If 'sectnum_xform' is False, the 'sectnum' directive triggers
    section numbering by LaTeX.
  - Use default font in admonitions and sidebar.
  - Typeset generic topic as "quote with title".
  - Use template (file and configuration option).
  - Render doctest blocks as literal blocks (indented).

* ODT writer:

  - moved from sandbox to Doctutils core.

* manpage writer:

  - moved from sandbox to Doctutils core.


Release 0.5 (2008-06-25)
