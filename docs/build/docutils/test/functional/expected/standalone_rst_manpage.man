.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
rst2man transforms a reStructured text document into a unix man page.
.sp
In theory any valid reStructured text document should be processable,
in reality this is
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
a goal, that is not met yet
.IP \(bu 2
a goal that might never be met, because only few constructs are
used in man pages \fIand\fP because the common text file does not adhere
to man page requirements.
.sp
For example a unix man page belongs into a numbered section, 1 is
user commands, 8 contains administrator commands and the headlines
of all manpages are collected into a database, queryable with the
programm \fBapropos\fP, therefore the headline should contain a short
text describing into which group this command belongs.
.sp
These informations are collected from title, subtitle and the
docinfo, see this document as an example.
