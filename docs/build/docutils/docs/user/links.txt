.. title:: Docutils Links

.. contents::

This document contains links users of Docutils and reStructuredText
may find useful.  Many of the project
listed here are hosted in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.  If you have
something to publish, you can get write access, too!

The most current version of this link list can always be found at
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/links.html.

Export
------

Convert reStructuredText to other formats:

PDF
```

* `rst2pdf (reportlab)
  <http://rst2pdf.googlecode.com>`_ is a tool to go
  directly from restructured text to PDF, via `reportlab
  <http://www.reportlab.org/rl_toolkit.html>`_. No LaTeX installation is
  required.

* `rst2pdf (pdflatex)
  <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/blais/rst2pdf/>`_ by Martin Blais
  is a minimal front end producing LaTeX, compiling the LaTeX file, getting
  the produced output to the destination location and finally deleting all
  the messy temporary files that this process generates.

* `rst2pdf (rubber)
  <http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/rst2pdf/README.html>`_ is
  a front end for the generation of PDF documents from a reStructuredText
  source via LaTeX in one step cleaning up intermediate files. It uses the
  `rubber <http://iml.univ-mrs.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/>`_ Python wrapper
  for LaTeX and friends.

* **py.rest** from the Codespeak `py Lib scripts`_ converts
  reStructuredText files to HTML and PDF (cleaning up the intermediate
  latex files).  Similar to ``buildhtml.py``, it looks recursively for
  .txt files in the given PATHS.

OpenOffice
``````````

* odtwriter_ the Open Document Format writer developed by Dave Kuhlman
  produces files that can be processed with OpenOffice and Abiword.
  Since version 0.5, the odtwriter_ it is part of the Docutils_ core.


HTML variants
`````````````

* The Sphinx_ Python Documentation Generator by Georg Brandl was originally
  created to translate the Python_ documentation, and is now `used by
  <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/examples.html>`__ a wide choice of projects.

  Generates web sites (interlinked and indexed HTML pages) and/or PDF
  from a set of rst source files.

* rst2ht_ by Oliver Rutherfurd, converts reStructuredText to an .ht
  template, for use with ht2html_.

* htmlnav_ by Gunnar Schwant, is an HTML writer which supports navigation
  bars.

* rest2web_, by Michael Foord, is a tool for creating web sites with
  reStructuredText.

* rst2chm_ by Oliver Rutherfurd, generates Microsoft HTML Help files from
  reStructuredText files.

* `html4strict <http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/html4strict/>`__
  produces XHTML that strictly conforms to the XHTML 1.0 specification.

* `html4trans <http://docutils.sf.net/sandbox/html4trans/>`__
  produces XHTML conforming to the version 1.0 Transitional DTD that
  contains enough formatting information to be viewed by a lightweight HTML
  browser without CSS support.

* A `simple HTML writer`_ by Bill Bumgarner that doesn't rely on CSS
  (stylesheets).


Others
``````

* Pandoc_ is a document converter that can write Markdown, reStructuredText,
  HTML, LaTeX, RTF, DocBook XML, and S5.

* restxsl_ by Michael Alyn Miller, lets you transform reStructuredText
  documents into XML/XHTML files using XSLT stylesheets.

* An `XSLT script`_ by Ladislav Lhotka enables reStructuredText annotations
  to be included in RELAG NG XML schemas.

* `ManPage Writer`_ by Engelbert Gruber.

* `DocBook Writer`_ by Oliver Rutherfurd.

* Nabu_, written by Martin Blais, is a publishing system which
  extracts information from reStructuredText documents and stores it
  in a database.  Python knowledge is required to write extractor
  functions (see `Writing an Extractor`_) and to retrieve the data
  from the database again.

* The `pickle writer`_ by Martin Blais pickles the document tree to a binary
  string. Later unpickling will allow you to publish with other Writers.


* The `Texinfo Writer`_, by Jon Waltman converts reStructuredText to
  Texinfo, the documentation format used by the GNU project and the
  Emacs text editor.  Texinfo can be used to produce multiple output
  formats, including HTML, PDF, and Info.


Import
------

Convert other formats to reStructuredText:

* sxw2rest_, by Trent W. Buck, converts StarOffice XML Writer (SXW)
  files to reStructuredText.

* xml2rst_, an XSLT stylesheet written by Stefan Merten, converts XML
  dumps of the document tree (e.g. created with rst2xml.py) back to
  reStructuredText.

* xhtml2rest_, written by Antonios Christofides, is a simple utility
  to convert XHTML to reStructuredText.

* Sphinx_ includes a `LaTeX to Rst converter
  <http://svn.python.org/projects/doctools/converter/>`__ in its source code
  (trimmed to importing the old Python docs).

* Pandoc_ can read Markdown and (subsets of) HTML, and LaTeX and export to
  (amongst others) reStructuredText.

* PySource_, by Tony Ibbs, is an experimental Python source Reader.
  There is some related code in David Goodger's sandbox
  (pysource_reader_) and a `Python Source Reader`_ document.


Extensions
----------

Extend the reStructuredText syntax or the features of Docutils.
More extensions are in the `Docutils Sandbox`_.

* Jens J. Mortensen developed `LaTeX math for reST`_, which writes to
  LaTeX or to MathML. It's included with Docutils since 0.8 (2010-11-05).

* BENI Cherniavsky has written a generic `preprocessing module`_ for
  roles and/or directives and built preprocessors for TeX math for
  both LaTeX and HTML output on top of it.

* Beni Cherniavsky maintains a Makefile_ for driving Docutils, hoping
  to handle everything one might do with Docutils.

* The `ASCII art to SVG converter`_ (aafigure) developed by
  Chris Liechti can parse ASCII art images, embedded in reST documents and
  output an image. This would mean that simple illustrations could be
  embedded as ASCII art in the reST source and still look nice when
  converted to e.g. HTML


Related Applications
--------------------

Applications using docutils/reStructuredText and helper applications.

* For Wikis, please see the `FAQ entry about Wikis`_.

* For Blogs (Weblogs), please see the `FAQ entry about Blogs`_.

Development
```````````

* Sphinx_ extends the ReStructuredText syntax to better support the
  documentation of Software (and other) *projects* (but other documents
  can be written with it too).

  Since version 2.6, the `Python documentation`_ is based on
  reStructuredText and Sphinx.

* Trac_, a project management and bug/issue tracking system, supports
  `using reStructuredText
  <http://projects.edgewall.com/trac/wiki/WikiRestructuredText>`__ as an
  alternative to wiki markup.

* PyLit_ provides a bidirectional text <--> code converter for *literate
  programming with reStructuredText*.

* If you are developing a Qt app, rst2qhc_ lets you generate the whole help
  automatically from restructured text. That includes keywords, TOC,
  multiple manuals per project, filters, project file, collection project
  file, and more.


CMS Systems
```````````

* Plone_ and Zope_ both support reStructuredText markup.
* ZReST_, by Richard Jones, is a "ReStructuredText Document for Zope_"
  application that is complete and ready to install.

Presentations
`````````````

* `native support for S5 <slide-shows.s5.html>`_;

* The `PythonPoint interface`_ by Richard Jones produces PDF
  presentations using ReportLabs' PythonPoint_.

* InkSlide_ quick and easy presentations using Inkscape_. InkSlide uses
  reStructuredText for markup, although it renders only a subset of rst.
