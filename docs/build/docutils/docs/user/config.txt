-------------------
Configuration Files
-------------------

Configuration files are used for persistent customization; they can be
set once and take effect every time you use a front-end tool.
Configuration file settings override the built-in defaults, and
command-line options override all.

By default, Docutils checks the following places for configuration
files, in the following order:

1. ``/etc/docutils.conf``: This is a system-wide configuration file,
   applicable to all Docutils processing on the system.

2. ``./docutils.conf``: This is a project-specific configuration file,
   located in the current directory.  The Docutils front end has to be
   executed from the directory containing this configuration file for
   it to take effect (note that this may have nothing to do with the
   location of the source files).  Settings in the project-specific
   configuration file will override corresponding settings in the
   system-wide file.

3. ``~/.docutils``: This is a user-specific configuration file,
   located in the user's home directory.  Settings in this file will
   override corresponding settings in both the system-wide and
   project-specific configuration files.

If more than one configuration file is found, all will be read but
later entries will override earlier ones.  For example, a "stylesheet"
entry in a user-specific configuration file will override a
"stylesheet" entry in the system-wide file.

The default implicit config file paths can be overridden by the
``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` environment variable.  ``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` should
contain a colon-separated (semicolon-separated on Windows) sequence of
config file paths to search for; leave it empty to disable implicit
config files altogether.  Tilde-expansion is performed on paths.
Paths are interpreted relative to the current working directory.
Empty path items are ignored.

In addition, a configuration file may be explicitly specified with the
"--config" command-line option.  This configuration file is read after
the three implicit ones listed above (or the ones defined by the
``DOCUTILSCONFIG`` environment variable), and its entries will have
priority.


-------------------------
Configuration File Syntax
-------------------------

Configuration files are UTF-8-encoded text files.  The
ConfigParser.py_ module from Python_'s standard library is used to
read them.  From its documentation:

    The configuration file consists of sections, lead by a "[section]"
    header and followed by "name: value" entries, with continuations
    in the style of `RFC 822`_; "name=value" is also accepted.  Note
    that leading whitespace is removed from values.  ...  Lines
    beginning with "#" or ";" are ignored and may be used to provide
    comments.

.. Note:: No format string interpolation is done.

Configuration file entry names correspond to internal runtime
settings.  Underscores ("_") and hyphens ("-") can be used
interchangably in entry names; hyphens are automatically converted to
underscores.

For on/off switch settings (booleans), the following values are
recognized:

* On: "true", "yes", "on", "1"
* Off: "false", "no", "off", "0", "" (no value)


Example
=======

This is the contents of the ``tools/docutils.conf`` configuration file
supplied with Docutils::

    # These entries affect all processing:
    [general]
    source-link: yes
    datestamp: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC
    generator: on

    # These entries affect HTML output:
    [html4css1 writer]
    # Required for docutils-update, the website build system:
    stylesheet-path: ../docutils/writers/html4css1/html4css1.css
    embed-stylesheet: no
    field-name-limit: 20

Individual configuration sections and settings are described in the
following section.


-------------------------------------
Configuration File Sections & Entries
-------------------------------------

Below are the Docutils runtime settings, listed by config file
section.  Any setting may be specified in any section, but only
settings from active sections will be used.  Sections correspond to
Docutils components (module name or alias; section names are always in
lowercase letters).  Each `Docutils application`_ uses a specific set
of components; corresponding configuration file sections are applied
when the application is used.  Configuration sections are applied in
general-to-specific order, as follows:

1. `[general]`_

2. `[parsers]`_, parser dependencies, and the section specific to the
   Parser used ("[... parser]").  Currently, only `[restructuredtext
   parser]`_ is applicable.

3. `[readers]`_, reader dependencies, and the section specific to the
   Reader used ("[... reader]").  For example, `[pep reader]`_ depends
   on `[standalone reader]`_.

4. `[writers]`_, writer dependencies, and the section specific to the
   Writer used ("[... writer]").  For example, `[pep_html writer]`_
   depends on `[html4css1 writer]`_.

5. `[applications]`_, application dependencies, and the section
    specific to the Application (front-end tool) in use
    ("[... application]").

Since any setting may be specified in any section, this ordering
allows component- or application-specific overrides of earlier
settings.  For example, there may be Reader-specific overrides of
general settings; Writer-specific overrides of Parser settings;
Application-specific overrides of Writer settings; and so on.

If multiple configuration files are applicable, the process is
completed (all sections are applied in the order given) for each one
before going on to the next.  For example, a "[pep_html writer]
stylesheet" setting in an earlier configuration file would be
overridden by an "[html4css1 writer] stylesheet" setting in a later
file.

Some knowledge of Python_ is assumed for some attributes.

[general]
=========

Settings in the "[general]" section are always applied.

_`auto_id_prefix`
    Prefix prepended to all auto-generated IDs generated within the
    document, after id_prefix_.

    Default: "id".  Options: ``--auto-id-prefix`` (hidden, intended
    mainly for programmatic use).

_`datestamp`
    Include a time/datestamp in the document footer.  Contains a
    format string for Python's ``time.strftime``.  See the `time
    module documentation`__.

    Default: None.  Options: ``--date, -d, --time, -t,
    --no-datestamp``.

    Configuration file entry examples::

        # Equivalent to --date command-line option, results in
        # ISO 8601 extended format datestamp, e.g. "2001-12-21":
        datestamp: %Y-%m-%d

        # Equivalent to --time command-line option, results in
        # date/timestamp like "2001-12-21 18:43 UTC":
        datestamp: %Y-%m-%d %H:%M UTC

        # Disables datestamp; equivalent to --no-datestamp:
        datestamp:

    The error handler for unencodable characters in error output.  See
    output_encoding_error_handler_ for acceptable values.

    Default: "backslashreplace" for Python 2.3 and later; "replace"
    otherwise.  Options: ``--error-encoding-error-handler,
    --error-encoding, -e``.

_`exit_status_level`
    A system message level threshold; non-halting system messages at
    or above this level will produce a non-zero exit status at normal
    exit.  Exit status is the maximum system message level plus 10 (11
    for INFO, etc.).

    Default: disabled (5).  Options: ``--exit-status``.

_`expose_internals`
    List of internal attribues to expose as external attributes (with
    "internal:" namespace prefix).  To specify multiple attributes in
    configuration files, use colons to separate names; on the command
    line, the option may be used more than once.

    Default: don't (None).  Options: ``--expose-internal-attribute``
    (hidden, for development use only).

_`footnote_backlinks`
    Enable or disable backlinks from footnotes and citations to their

_`input_encoding`
    The text encoding for input.

    Default: auto-detect (None).  Options: ``--input-encoding, -i``.

_`input_encoding_error_handler`
    The error handler for undecodable characters in the input.
    Acceptable values include:

    strict
        Raise an exception in case of an encoding error.
    replace
        Replace malformed data with the official Unicode replacement
        character, U+FFFD.
    ignore
        Ignore malformed data and continue without further notice.

    Acceptable values are the same as for the "error" parameter of
    Python's ``unicode`` function; other values may be defined in
    applications or in future versions of Python.

    Default: "strict".  Options: ``--input-encoding-error-handler,
    --input-encoding, -i``.

_`language_code`
    Case-insensitive `language tag`_ as defined in `BCP 47`_.

    Sets the document language, also used for localized directive and
    role names as well as Docutils-generated text.

    A typical language identifier consists of a 2-letter language code
    from `ISO 639`_ (3-letter codes can be used if no 2-letter code
    exists). The language identifier can have an optional subtag,
    typically for variations based on country (from `ISO 3166`_
    2-letter country codes).  Avoid subtags except where they add
    useful distinguishing information. Examples of language tags
    include "fr", "en-GB", "pt_br" (the same as "pt-BR"), and
    "de-1901" (German with pre-1998 spelling).

    The language of document parts can be specified with a
    "language-<language tag>" `class attribute`_, e.g.
    ``.. class:: language-el-polyton`` for a quote in polytonic Greek.

    Default: English ("en").  Options: ``--language, -l``.

    .. _class attribute: ../ref/doctree.html#classes

_`output_encoding`
    The text encoding for output.

    Default: "UTF-8".  Options: ``--output-encoding, -o``.

_`output_encoding_error_handler`
    The error handler for unencodable characters in the output.
    Acceptable values include:

    strict
        Raise an exception in case of an encoding error.
    replace
        Replace malformed data with a suitable replacement marker,
        such as "?".
    ignore
        Ignore malformed data and continue without further notice.
    xmlcharrefreplace
        Replace with the appropriate XML character reference, such as
        "``&#8224;``".
    backslashreplace
        (Python 2.3+)  Replace with backslashed escape sequences, such
        as "``\u2020``".

    Acceptable values are the same as for the "error" parameter of
    Python's ``encode`` string method; other values may be defined in
    applications or in future versions of Python.

    Default: "strict".  Options: ``--output-encoding-error-handler,
    --output-encoding, -o``.

_`record_dependencies`
    Path to a file where Docutils will write a list of files that the
    input and output depend on [#dependencies]_, e.g. due to file
    inclusion. [#pwd]_ The format is one filename per line.  This
    option is particularly useful in conjunction with programs like
    ``make``.

    Set to ``-`` in order to write dependencies to stdout.

    Default: None.  Option: ``--record-dependencies``.

_`report_level`
    Verbosity threshold at or above which system messages are
    reported.

    Default: warning (2).  Options: ``--report, -r, --verbose, -v,
    --quiet, -q``.

_`sectnum_xform`
    Enable or disable automatic section numbering by Docutils
    (docutils.transforms.parts.SectNum) associated with the `sectnum
    directive`_.

    If disabled, section numbers might be added to the output by the
    renderer (e.g. LaTeX or via a CSS style definition).

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--section-numbering``,
    ``--no-section-numbering``.

    .. _sectnum directive: ../ref/rst/directives.html#sectnum

_`source_link`
    Include a "View document source" link in the document footer.  URL
    will be relative to the destination.

    Default: don't (None).  Options: ``--source-link, -s,
    --no-source-link``.

_`source_url`
    An explicit URL for a "View document source" link, used verbatim.

    Default: compute if source_link (None).  Options: ``--source-url,
    --no-source-link``.

_`strict_visitor`
    When processing a document tree with the Visitor pattern, raise an
    error if a writer does not support a node type listed as optional.
    For transitional development use.

    Default: disabled (None).  Option: ``--strict-visitor`` (hidden,
    for development use only).

_`strip_classes`
    List of "classes" attribute values to remove from all elements in
    the document tree.

    .. WARNING:: Potentially dangerous; use with caution.

    Default: disabled (None).  Option: ``--strip-class``.

_`strip_comments`
    Enable the removal of comment elements from the document tree.

    Default: disabled (None).  Options: ``--strip-comments``,
    ``--leave-comments``.

_`strip_elements_with_classes`
    List of "classes" attribute values; matching elements to be
    removed from the document tree.

    .. WARNING:: Potentially dangerous; use with caution.

    Default: disabled (None).  Option: ``--strip-element-with-class``.

_`title`
    The document title as metadata, which does not become part of the
    document body.  It overrides a document-supplied title.  For
    example, in HTML output the metadata document title appears in the
    title bar of the browser window.

    Default: none.  Option: ``--title``.

_`toc_backlinks`
    Enable backlinks from section titles to table of contents entries
    ("entry"), to the top of the TOC ("top"), or disable ("none").

    Default: "entry".  Options: ``--toc-entry-backlinks,
    --toc-top-backlinks, --no-toc-backlinks``.

_`traceback`
    Enable Python tracebacks when halt-level system messages and other
    exceptions occur.  Useful for debugging, and essential for issue
    reports.  Exceptions are allowed to propagate, instead of being
    caught and reported (in a user-friendly way) by Docutils.

    Default: disabled (None) unless Docutils is run programmatically
    using the `Publisher Interface`_.  Options: ``--traceback,
    --no-traceback``.

    .. _Publisher Interface: ../api/publisher.html

_`warning_stream`
    Path to a file for the output of system messages (warnings)
    [#pwd]_.

[restructuredtext parser]
`````````````````````````

_`file_insertion_enabled`
    Enable or disable directives that insert the contents of external
    files, such as the "include_" & "raw_".  A "warning" system
    message (including the directive text) is inserted instead.  (See
    also raw_enabled_ for another security-relevant setting.)

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--file-insertion-enabled,

    --leave-footnote-reference-space``.

__ `footnote_references [latex2e writer]`_


[readers]
---------


[standalone reader]
```````````````````

_`docinfo_xform`
    Enable or disable the bibliographic field list transform
    (docutils.transforms.frontmatter.DocInfo).

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--no-doc-info``.

_`doctitle_xform`
    Enable or disable the promotion of a lone top-level section title
    to document title (and subsequent section title to document
    subtitle promotion; docutils.transforms.frontmatter.DocTitle).

Under construction.


[writers]
---------

[docutils_xml writer]
`````````````````````

_`doctype_declaration`
    Generate XML with a DOCTYPE declaration.

    Default: do (1).  Options: ``--no-doctype``.

_`indents`
    Generate XML with indents and newlines.

    Default: don't (None).  Options: ``--indents``.

_`newlines`
    Generate XML with newlines before and after tags.

    Default: don't (None).  Options: ``--newlines``.

.. _xml_declaration [docutils_xml writer]:

xml_declaration
    Generate XML with an XML declaration.  Also defined for the
    `HTML Writer`__.

    .. Caution:: The XML declaration carries text encoding
       information, without which standard tools may be unable to read
       the generated XML.

    Default: do (1).  Options: ``--no-xml-declaration``.

    __ `xml_declaration [html4css1 writer]`_


[html4css1 writer]
``````````````````

.. _attribution [html4css1 writer]:

attribution
    Format for block quote attributions: one of "dash" (em-dash
    prefix), "parentheses"/"parens", or "none".  Also defined for the
    `LaTeX Writer`__.

    Default: "dash".  Options: ``--attribution``.

    __ `attribution [latex2e writer]`_

_`cloak_email_addresses`
    Scramble email addresses to confuse harvesters.  In the reference
    URI, the "@" will be replaced by %-escapes (as of RFC 1738).  In
    the visible text (link text) of an email reference, the "@" and
    all periods (".") will be surrounded by ``<span>`` tags.
    Furthermore, HTML entities are used to encode these characters in
    order to further complicate decoding the email address.  For
    example, "abc@example.org" will be output as::

        <a class="reference" href="mailto:abc&#37;&#52;&#48;example&#46;org">
        abc<span>&#64;</span>example<span>&#46;</span>org</a>

    .. Note:: While cloaking email addresses will have little to no
       impact on the rendering and usability of email links in most
       browsers, some browsers (e.g. the ``links`` browser) may decode
       cloaked email addresses incorrectly.

    Default: don't cloak (None).  Option: ``--cloak-email-addresses``.

_`compact_lists`
    Remove extra vertical whitespace between items of bullet lists and
    enumerated lists, when list items are all "simple" (i.e., items
    each contain one paragraph and/or one "simple" sublist only).  The
    behaviour can be specified directly via "class" attributes (values
    "compact" and "open") in the document.

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--compact-lists,
    --no-compact-lists``.

_`compact_field_lists`
    Remove extra vertical whitespace between items of field lists that
    are "simple" (i.e., all field bodies each contain at most one
    paragraph).  The behaviour can be specified directly via "class"
    attributes (values "compact" and "open") in the document.

    Default: enabled (1).  Options: ``--compact-field-lists,
    --no-compact-field-lists``.

.. _embed_stylesheet [html4css1 writer]:

embed_stylesheet
    Embed the stylesheet in the output HTML file.  The stylesheet file
    must specified by the stylesheet_path__ setting and must be
    accessible during processing.
    Also defined for the `LaTeX Writer`__.

    Default: enabled.  Options: ``--embed-stylesheet,
    --link-stylesheet``.

    __ `stylesheet_path [html4css1 writer]`_
    __ `embed_stylesheet [latex2e writer]`_

_`field_name_limit`
    The maximum width (in characters) for one-column field names.
    Longer field names will span an entire row of the table used to
    render the field list.  0 indicates "no limit".  See also
    option_limit_.

    Default: 14 characters.  Option: ``--field-name-limit``.

.. _footnote_references [html4css1 writer]:

footnote_references
    Format for footnote references, one of "superscript" or
    "brackets".  Also defined for the `LaTeX Writer`__.

    Overrides [#override]_ trim_footnote_reference_space_, if
    applicable. [#footnote_space]_

    Default: "brackets".  Option: ``--footnote-references``.

    __ `footnote_references [latex2e writer]`_

_`initial_header_level`
    The initial level for header elements.  This does not affect the
    document title & subtitle; see doctitle_xform_.

    Default: 1 (for "<h1>").  Option: ``--initial-header-level``.

_`math_output`
    The format of mathematical content (`math directive`_ and role) in
    the output document. Supported values are:

    :MathJax:
      Format math for display with MathJax_, a JavaScript-based math
      rendering engine that uses HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and unicode
      fonts for high-quality typesetting that is scalable and prints
      at full resolution.

      Pro:
        Works 'out of the box' across multiple browsers and platforms.

        Supports a large subset of LaTeX math commands and constructs
        (see http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/tex.html).

      Con:
        Requires an Internet connection or a local MathJax
        installation.

    :HTML:
      Format math in standard HTML enhanced by CSS rules

      Requires the ``math.css`` stylesheet (stored in the same
      installation-dependent directory as the `default stylesheet
      <stylesheet_path [html4css1 writer]>`__

    :MathML:
      Embed math content as presentational MathML_.

      Pro:
        The W3C recommendation for math on the web.

        Self-contained documents (no JavaScript, no external downloads).

      Con:
        Docutil's latex2mathml converter supports only a small
        subset of LaTeX syntax.

        With the "html4css1" writer, the resulting HTML document does
        not validate, as there is no DTD for MathML + XHTML
        Transitional. However, MathML-enabled browsers will render it
        fine.

embed_stylesheet
    Embed the stylesheet(s) in the header of the output file.  The
    stylesheets must be accessible during processing.  Currently, this
    fails if the file is not available via the given path (i.e. the
    file is *not* searched in the `TeX input path`_).

    If `embed_stylesheet`__ is False (default), the stylesheet files are
    referenced with ``\usepackage`` (extension ``.sty`` or no extension) or
    ``\input`` (any other extension).

    LaTeX will search the specified files in the `TeX input path`_.

    Similar to stylesheet__, however paths [#pwd]_ are rewritten relative to
    the output file (if there is a common part in the given path and the
    output file path). Also defined for the `HTML Writer`__.

    Run ``latex`` from the directory containing the output file. Fails for
    files in the TEXINPUTS path; use stylesheet__ in this case.

_`latex_preamble`
    LaTeX code that will be inserted in the document preamble.
    Can be used to load packages with options or (re-) define LaTeX
    macros without writing a custom style file (new in Docutils 0.7).

    Default: Load the "PDF standard fonts" (Times, Helvetica,
    Courier)::

      \usepackage{mathptmx} % Times
      \usepackage[scaled=.90]{helvet}
      \usepackage{courier}

    Option: ``--latex-preamble``


.. _template [latex2e writer]:

template
    Path to template file, which must be encoded in UTF-8 [#pwd]_.
    Also defined for the `HTML Writer`__.

    Default: "default.tex" in the docutils/writers/latex2e/
    directory (installed automatically; for the exact machine-specific
    path, use the ``--help`` option).  Options: ``--template``.

    __ `template [html4css1 writer]`_

.. _footnote_references [latex2e writer]:

footnote_references
    Format for footnote references: one of "superscript" or
    "brackets".  Also defined for the `HTML Writer`__.

    Overrides [#override]_ trim_footnote_reference_space_, if
    applicable [#footnote_space]_.

    Default: "superscript".  Option: ``--footnote-references``.

    __ `footnote_references [html4css1 writer]`_

.. _attribution [latex2e writer]:

attribution
    Format for block quote attributions, the same as for the
    html-writer: one of "dash" (em-dash prefix),
    "parentheses"/"parens" or "none".  Also defined for the `HTML
    Writer`__.

    Default: "dash".  Option: ``--attribution``.

    __ `attribution [html4css1 writer]`_

_`compound_enumerators`
    Enable or disable compound enumerators for nested enumerated lists
    (e.g. "1.2.a.ii").

    Default: disabled (None).  Options: ``--compound-enumerators``,
    ``--no-compound-enumerators``.

_`literal_block_env`
    When possibile\ [#]_, use the specified environment for literal-blocks.

    Default: "" (quoting of whitespace and special chars)
    Option: ``--literal-block-env``

   .. [#] A literal-block element, when processed by a Docutils writer might
      have it's origin in a markup with "::" syntax or a "..
      parsed-literal::" directive.

      A LaTeX verbatim environment is only usable if there is no other
      markup contained in the literal-block.


_`section_prefix_for_enumerators`
    Enable or disable section ("." subsection ...) prefixes for
    compound enumerators.  This has no effect unless
    `compound_enumerators`_ are enabled.

    Default: disabled (None).  Options:
    ``--section-prefix-for-enumerators``,
    ``--no-section-prefix-for-enumerators``.

_`section_enumerator_separator`
    The separator between section number prefix and enumerator for
    compound enumerated lists (see `compound_enumerators`_).

    Generally it isn't recommended to use both sub-sections and nested
    enumerated lists with compound enumerators.  This setting avoids
    ambiguity in the situation where a section "1" has a list item
    enumerated "1.1", and subsection "1.1" has list item "1".  With a
    separator of ".", these both would translate into a final compound
    enumerator of "1.1.1".  With a separator of "-", we get the
    unambiguous "1-1.1" and "1.1-1".

    Default: "-".  Option: ``--section-enumerator-separator``.

.. _table_style [latex2e writer]:

table_style
    Specify the drawing of separation lines.
    Supported values:

    standard
      lines around and between cells.
    booktabs
      a line above and below the table and one after the head.
    borderless
      no lines.

    Default: "standard".  Option: ``--table-style``.

[xetex writer]
.................

The xetex writer derives from the latex2e writer, and shares
all settings defined in the `[latex2e writer]`_ section.  The
"[latex2e writer]" section of configuration files is processed
before the "[xetex writer]" section.

The following settings differ from those of the latex2e writer:

font_encoding
    Disabled as XeTeX uses Unicode-encoded fonts.

.. _latex_preamble [xetex writer]:

latex_preamble
    LaTeX code that will be inserted in the document preamble.

    Default:
      Font setup for `Linux Libertine`_,::

        % Linux Libertine (free, wide coverage, not only for Linux)
        \setmainfont{Linux Libertine O}
        \setsansfont{Linux Biolinum O}
        \setmonofont[HyphenChar=None]{DejaVu Sans Mono}

      The optional argument ``HyphenChar=None`` to the monospace font
      prevents word hyphenation in literal text.


    Option: ``--latex-preamble``

    .. _Linux Libertine: http://www.linuxlibertine.org/

.. _template [xetex writer]:

template
    Path to template file.

    Default: "xelatex.tex" in the ``docutils/writers/latex2e/``
    directory (installed automatically; for the exact machine-specific
    path, use the ``--help`` option).  Options: ``--template``.

No settings are defined for this Writer.


[applications]
--------------

[buildhtml application]
```````````````````````

_`ignore`
    List of wildcard (shell globing) patterns to silently ignore.  To
    specify multiple patterns in configuration files, use
    colon-separated patterns; on the command line, the option may be
    used more than once.

    Default: ['.svn', 'CVS'].  Options: ``--ignore``.

_`prune`
    List of directories not to process.  To specify multiple
    directories in configuration files, use colon-separated paths; on
    the command line, the option may be used more than once.

    Default: none ([]).  Options: ``--prune``.

_`recurse`
    Recursively scan subdirectories, or ignore subdirectories.

    Default: recurse (1).  Options: ``--recurse, --local``.

_`silent`
    Work silently (no progress messages).  Independent of
    "report_level".

    Default: show progress (None).  Options: ``--silent``.

Other Settings
==============

Command-Line Only
-----------------

These settings are only effective as command-line options; setting
them in configuration files has no effect.

_`config`
    Path to a configuration file to read (if it exists) [#pwd]_.
    Settings may override defaults and earlier settings.  The config
    file is processed immediately.  Multiple ``--config`` options may
    be specified; each will be processed in turn.

    Filesystem path settings contained within the config file will be
    interpreted relative to the config file's location (*not* relative
    to the current working directory).

    Default: None.  Options: ``--config``.


Internal Settings
-----------------

These settings are for internal use only; setting them in
configuration files has no effect, and there are no corresponding
command-line options.

_`_config_files`
    List of paths of applied configuration files.

    Default: None.  No command-line options.

_`_directories`
    (``buildhtml.py`` front end.)  List of paths to source
    directories, set from positional arguments.

    Default: current working directory (None).  No command-line
    options.

_`_disable_config`
    Prevent standard configuration files from being read.  For
    programmatic use only.

    Default: config files enabled (None).  No command-line options.

_`_destination`
    Path to output destination, set from positional arguments.

    Default: stdout (None).  No command-line options.

_`_source`
    Path to input source, set from positional arguments.

    Default: stdin (None).  No command-line options.

   02iso-3166-code-lists/index.html

.. [#pwd] Path relative to the working directory of the process at
   launch.

.. [#override] The overridden setting will automatically be set to
   ``None`` for command-line options and config file settings.  Client
   programs which specify defaults that override other settings must
   do the overriding explicitly, by assigning ``None`` to the other
   settings.

.. [#dependencies] Some notes on the dependency recorder:

   * Images are only added to the dependency list if the
     reStructuredText parser extracted image dimensions from the file.

   * Stylesheets are only added if they are embedded.

   * For practical reasons, the output of the LaTeX writer is
     considered merely an *intermediate* processing stage.  The
     dependency recorder records all files the *rendered* file
     (e.g. in PDF or DVI format) depends on.  Thus, images and
     stylesheets are both unconditionally recorded as dependencies
     when using the LaTeX writer.

.. [#footnote_space] The footnote space is trimmed if the reference
   style is "superscript", and it is left if the reference style is
   "brackets".

   The overriding only happens if the parser supports the
   trim_footnote_reference_space option.


------------------------------
Old-Format Configuration Files
------------------------------

Formerly, Docutils configuration files contained a single "[options]"
section only.  This was found to be inflexible, and in August 2003
Docutils adopted the current component-based configuration file
sections as described above.  Docutils will still recognize the old
"[options]" section, but complains with a deprecation warning.

To convert existing config files, the easiest way is to change the
section title: change "[options]" to "[general]".  Most settings
haven't changed.  The only ones to watch out for are these:
